# What we know about the dataset:

Members have the biggest proportion of the dataset, ~19% bigger thand casuals.
There's more data points at the last semester of 2020.
The month with the biggest count of data points was August with ~18% of the dataset.
In all months we have more members' rides than casual rides.
The difference of proporcion of member x casual is smaller in the last semester of 2020.
Temperature heavily influences the volume of rides in the month.
The biggest volume of data is on the the weekend.
There's a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon.

It's possible to notice that the distribution of rides by month is cyclical through years, as seen on chart 02 and it's influenced by the temperature. The remaining question is: Why are there more members than casual? One plausible answer is that members have a bigger need for the bikes than casuals, as can be seen on how there are more members than casuals on cold months.

Besides that, we have more bike rides on the weekends. Maybe because on those days the bikes were utilized for more recreational ways. This even more plausible when knowing that There's a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon.

# Now for how members differs from casuals:

Members may have the biggest volume of data, besides on saturday. On this weekday, casuals take place as having the most data points.
Weekends have the biggest volume of casuals, starting on friday, a ~20% increase.
We have more members during the morning, mainly between 5am and 11am. And more casuals between 11pm and 4am.
There's a big increase of data points in the midweek between 6am to 8am for members. Then it fell a bit. Another big increase is from 5pm to 6pm.

During the weekend we have a bigger flow of casuals between 11am to 6pm.

Casuals have more riding time than members.
Riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends.
Casuals follow a more curve distribution, peaking on sundays and valleying on wednesday/thursday.
What we can take from this information is that members have a more fixed use for bikes besides casuals. Their uses is for more routine activities, like:


This can be proven we state that we have more members in between 6am to 8am and at 5pm to 6pm. Also, members may have set routes when using the bikes, as proven by riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends. The bikes is also heavily used for recreation on the weekends, when riding time increases and casuals take place.

Members also have a bigger preference for classic bikes, so they can exercise when going to work.
