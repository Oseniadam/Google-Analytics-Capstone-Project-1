It's possible to notice that the distribution of rides by month is cyclical through years, as seen on chart 02 and it's influenced by the temperature. The remaining question is: Why are there more members than casual? One plausible answer is that members have a bigger need for the bikes than casuals, as can be seen on how there are more members than casuals on cold months.

Besides that, we have more bike rides on the weekends. Maybe because on those days the bikes were utilized for more recreational ways. This even more plausible when knowing that There's a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon.

What we can take from this information is that members have a more fixed use for bikes besides casuals. 
Their uses is for more routine activities, like Work and Exercise. 

This can be proven we state that we have more members in between 6am to 8am and at 5pm to 6pm. Also, members may have set routes when using the bikes, as proven by riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends. The bikes is also heavily used for recreation on the weekends, when riding time increases and casuals take place.

Members also have a bigger preference for classic bikes, so they can exercise when going to work.
