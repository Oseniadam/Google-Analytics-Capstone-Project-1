It's possible to notice that the distribution of rides by month is cyclical through years, as seen on chart 02 and it's influenced by the temperature. The remaining question is: Why are there more members than casual? One plausible answer is that members have a bigger need for the bikes than casuals, as can be seen on how there are more members than casuals on cold months.

Besides that, we have more bike rides on the weekends. Maybe because on those days the bikes were utilized for more recreational ways. This even more plausible when knowing that There's a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon.


# On this weekday, casuals take place as having the most data points.
1 Weekends have the biggest volume of casuals, starting on friday, a ~20% increase.

2 We have more members during the morning, mainly between 5am and 11am. 

3 We also have more casuals between 11pm and 4am.

4 There's a big increase of data points in the midweek between 6am to 8am for members. 

# During the weekend 
1 We have a bigger flow of casuals between 11am to 6pm.

2 Members have a bigger preference for classic bikes, 56% more.

3 Casuals have more riding time than members.

4 Riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends.

5 Casuals follow a more curve distribution, peaking on sundays and valleying on wednesday/thursday.


What we can take from this information is that members have a more fixed use for bikes besides casuals. 
Their uses is for more routine activities, like Work and Exercise. 

This can be proven we state that we have more members in between 6am to 8am and at 5pm to 6pm. Also, members may have set routes when using the bikes, as proven by riding time for members keeps unchanged during the midweek, increasing during weekends. The bikes is also heavily used for recreation on the weekends, when riding time increases and casuals take place.

Members also have a bigger preference for classic bikes, so they can exercise when going to work.

# Concluding:
Members use the bikes for fixed activities, one of those is going to work.
Bikes are used for recreation on the weekends.
Rides are influenced by temperature.
